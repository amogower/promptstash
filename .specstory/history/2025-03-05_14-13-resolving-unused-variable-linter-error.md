## Resolving Unused Variable Linter Error (05/03/2025, 14:13:00)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'lastOpenIndex' is assigned a value but never used.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I notice that `lastOpenIndex` is being assigned but never used in the code, and it doesn't appear to serve any purpose in the validation logic. Since the variable isn't contributing to the functionality (we're already tracking open brackets with the `stack` array), we can safely remove it.

I'll remove the unused variable declaration and assignment:

---

_****_

```diff
    const stack: number[] = [];
    let openBracketCount = 0;
-   let lastOpenIndex = -1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < content.length; i++) {
      if (content[i] === '{' && content[i + 1] === '{') {
        stack.push(i);
        openBracketCount++;
-       lastOpenIndex = i;
        i++; // Skip the next bracket
      } else if (content[i] === '}' && content[i + 1] === '}') {
```

I notice there's also another linter error about `openBracketCount` being assigned but never used. Would you like me to address that as well?

_**Assistant**_

Since `openBracketCount` is being tracked but never used in the validation logic (we're using the `stack` array to handle all the bracket matching), we can safely remove it. The `stack` array already provides all the functionality we need for tracking unmatched brackets.

---

_****_

```diff
    // Check for unmatched brackets
    const stack: number[] = [];
-   let openBracketCount = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < content.length; i++) {
      if (content[i] === '{' && content[i + 1] === '{') {
        stack.push(i);
-       openBracketCount++;
        i++; // Skip the next bracket
      } else if (content[i] === '}' && content[i + 1] === '}') {
        } else {
          stack.pop();
-         openBracketCount--;
        }
        i++; // Skip the next bracket
```

---

This removes the unused variable and its operations while maintaining the exact same validation functionality, as we're still properly tracking bracket pairs using the `stack` array.
