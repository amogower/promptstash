## Netlify Deployment Setup Assistance (05/03/2025, 15:04:52)

_**User**_

I want to deploy this app to Netlify. Can you add all the necessary setup for me to do that? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up the deployment configuration for Netlify. First, let me check the project structure to understand what kind of setup we need.

I see this is a Vite + TypeScript project. For Netlify deployment, we need to add two main things:
1. A `netlify.toml` configuration file
2. Proper build settings in the configuration

Let me create the `netlify.toml` file first:

---

```diff
- 
+ [build]
+   command = "pnpm run build"
+   publish = "dist"
+ 
+ [dev]
+   command = "pnpm run dev"
+   port = 5173
+ 
+ [[redirects]]
+   from = "/*"
+   to = "/index.html"
+   status = 200 
```

---

Let me explain what I've set up:

1. The `netlify.toml` file contains:
   - Build configuration that uses `pnpm run build` as the build command and publishes from the `dist` directory
   - Development settings for local testing
   - A redirect rule that ensures your single-page application (SPA) routes work correctly

To deploy to Netlify, you'll need to:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Sign up for a Netlify account if you haven't already
3. In Netlify:
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect to your Git provider and select your repository
   - The build settings will be automatically detected from the `netlify.toml` file
   - Click "Deploy site"

Important notes:
1. Make sure your `.gitignore` includes the `dist` directory and `.env` files
2. If you have environment variables, you'll need to add them in Netlify's site settings under "Environment variables"
3. Netlify will automatically detect that this is a Vite project and set up the appropriate build settings

Would you like me to check your `.gitignore` to make sure it's properly configured for deployment?

Can you also add a GitHub workflow to deploy this on the main branch? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy to Netlify when changes are pushed to the main branch. First, I'll create the necessary workflow file:
